shadd = super hadd!!! (This is about the ROOT package)

Use it to hadd together large number of root files (> 500)

Usage: shadd out.root in.txt

   - out.root is the name of the output root file

   - in.txt is the name of a text file with the list of the
     input root files. Create one with something like
     ls myfiles_*.root > in.txt

A glimps inside: shadd submits an array of slurm jobs (so it can be only used
on the systems with installed slurm, check out slurm.schedmd.com) each one
of these jobs hadds Nlines files. By default Nlines=200, change it according
the characteristics of your computer in shadd.cfg file (there are few other 
settings that you might want to change as well). After finishing all these
slurm jobs the final output root file will be created by merging together
the temporary files. Shadd is slow (typically it takes about a minute to
complete), but it doesn't load your interactive shell, so other users won't
complaint about the slowness of the system. Moreover, your hadd may crush
if the number of the input files is more than ~1000. Shadd does not have this
limitation. If the number of input files is huge (100000 and more) consider using
shadd in non-interactive mode (see shadd.cfg) and use shadd over the output
of the first run of shadd.

Take a look at the slurm options in submit_hadd.sh. You may want to change them
according to your needs.

IN ORDER TO USE SHADD ADD THE FOLLOWING LINE TO YOUR ~/.bash_profile
source $HOME/.shadd/shadd
