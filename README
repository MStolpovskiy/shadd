shadd = super hadd!!! (This is about the ROOT package)

Use it to hadd together large number of root files (> 500)

Usage: shadd -options out.root in.txt

   - where -options are the same as in hadd command
     just pay attention to write them glued together
     like, for example, -fk to force recreate existent
     output file and ignore corrupted files in the input

   - out.root is the name of the output root file

   - in.txt is the name of a text file with the list of the
     input root files. Create one with something like
     ls myfiles_*.root > in.txt

A glimps inside: shadd submits several slurm jobs (so it can be only used
on the systems with installed slurm, check out slurm.schedmd.com) each one
of these jobs hadds Nlines files. By default Nlines=200, change it according
the characteristics of your computer in shadd.cfg file (there are few other 
settings that you might want to change as well). After finishing all these
slurm jobs the final output root file will be created by merging together
the temporary files. Shadd is slow (typically it takes couple minutes to
complete), but it doesn't load your interactive shell, so other users won't
complaint about the slowness of the system. Moreover, your hadd may crush
if the number of the input files is more than ~1000. Shadd does not have this
limitation.

Take a look at the slurm options in submit_hadd.sh. You may want to change them
according to your needs.
